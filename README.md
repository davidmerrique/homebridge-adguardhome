Display AdGuard Home as a lock or switch accesory.

## Notes

1. When updating from 1.5.1 to 1.6.0 you might need to re-add your accessories again in Home app.
2. When creating multiple timer, Home app will assign the same name for all accessories, this is expected behaviour ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. You need to rename them manually.
